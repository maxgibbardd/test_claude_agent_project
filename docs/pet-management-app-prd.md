**International Pricing Strategy**:
- Purchasing power parity adjustments for international markets
- Local payment method integration (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
- Currency hedging for revenue predictability
- Regional promotional pricing for market entry

### Monetization Optimization

**Conversion Funnel Optimization**:
- Free tier designed with intentional limitations to encourage upgrades
- In-app upgrade prompts triggered by usage patterns and feature limits
- Time-limited trials for premium features to demonstrate value
- Family sharing upgrades to premium for multi-pet households

**Revenue Per User Growth**:
- Upselling professional features to high-engagement users
- Cross-selling marketplace services to subscription users
- Annual payment discounts to improve cash flow and reduce churn
